Leaflet is an opensource Javascript package for interactive maps, the Leaflet package allows these visualisations to be created in R.
It is one of several visualisation packages that allow R users to produce professional-style visualisations - which has established it as a challenger to click-and-drag visualisation programs, such as Power BI and Tableau.

There are valid pros to both.

#### Advantages Leaflet 
* R is free*, Tableau is expensive.         
* Removes need for audience/end users to have tableau server access - flexible export options (html, github site, markdown, powerpoint/ms office, pdf, others).
* Programmatic visualisation more flexible/customisable (ie custom shapes and geometries outside of state/postcode).
* Reproducibility.
* Enhanced possibilities for automation/interactivity (with shiny).

#### Advantages Tableau
* Many companies may have existing infrastructure in Tableau.
* Easier to learn, doesnt require coding background.
* Visualisations generally quicker to produce through click-and-drag.

I've always found Tableau to be quite slow to run, and leaflet maps, once rendered to html, seem to run a lot quicker.
However I couldnt find any information online to back up that observation, so it may not be true in all use cases.

## Jobseeker Rate by LGA, 2020
I had a look at Jobseeker data around Australia in 2020.
Results are very intuitive (regional areas and low socioeconomic areas have higher rates of Jobseeker).
Jobkeeper would make an interesting supplementary visualisation, as it would feature more in large cities and tourism locations.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
m1
```

Chloropleths are sensitive to unbalanced data, particularly when different regions have vastly different populations (ie: above. Maralinga LGA has 64 people, Canterbury-Bankstown has 378k.)
A lot of visualisations dont adjust for these very well, and the end result ends up just being a population map of the area. 
Thats why I've presented jobkeeper as a % rather than a #.
