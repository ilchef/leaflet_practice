## Using Leaflet + htmltools for GIS analytics and visualisation

R package

#### Advantages Leaflet 
* R is free*, Tableau is expensive         
* Removes need for audience/end users to have tableau server access - flexible export options (html, github site, markdown, powerpoint/ms office, pdf, others).
* Programmatic visualisation more flexible/customisable
* Reproducibility
* Enhanced possibilities for automation/interactivity (with shiny)

#### Advantages Tableau
* Many companies may have existing infrastructure in Tableau
* Easier to learn, doesnt require coding background
* Visualisations generally quicker to produce through click-and-drag
